\subsection{Structure of the Paper}

In Section~\ref{sec:scorex} we explain the architecture of the Scorex framework. We then describe our approach to property-based testing of blockchain system properties and present many examples of blockchain property tests in Section~\ref{sec:props}. Finally we state our conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
