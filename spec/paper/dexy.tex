\section{Introduction}

Algorithmic stablecoins is a natural extension of cryptocurrencies, trying to 
solve problems with volatility of their prices by pegging stablecoin price to an
asset which price believed to be more or less stable with time (e.g. 1 gram of gold).  

Stable pricing could be useful for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item securing fundraising; a project can be sure that funds collected during fundraising will have stable value in the mid- and long-term.
\item doing business with predictable results. For example, a hosting provider can be sure that payments collected at the beginning of the month 
      would be about the same at the end of the month when the provider will need to pay the bills. 
\item shorting: when cryptocurrency prices are high, it is desirable for investors to rebalance their portfolio by increasing exposure to fiat currencies (or traditional
 commodities). However, as KYC procedures are often cumbersome or not possible, it would be better to buy fiat and commodity substitues in form of stablecoins on decentralized exchanges.
\item lending and other decentralized finance applications. Stability of asset value is critical for many applications.
\end{enumerate}

Algorithmic stablecoins are different from centralized stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, which are 
convertible into underlying (pegged asset) via a trusted party. In case of an algorithmic stablecoin, its 
pegging is done via rebasement of total supply, or via imitating the trusted party, which holds. 


\section{General Design}

Unlike popular algorithmic stablecoins based on two tokens (instruments), \dx{} is based on one token but two protocols. In the first place, 
there is market where trading of \dx{} vs the base currency (\bc{}) happens. In the second place, if market price is way too different from target price (reported by an oracle), there is an algorithmic central bank which makes interventions. The central bank can also mint new \dx{} tokens, selling them for \bc{}. The bank is using reserves in \bc{} it is buying for interventions then. 

As a simple solution for the market, we are using constant-factor Automated Market Maker (CF-AMM) liquidity pool, similar to ErgoDEX and UniSwap. The pool has \bc{} on one side and \dx{} on another. For CF-AMM pool, multiplication of \bc{} and \dx{} amounts before and after a trade should be preserved, so $e * u = e' * u'$, where $e$ and $u$ are amounts of \bc{} and \dx{} in the pool before the trade, and $e'$ and $u'$ are amounts of \bc{} and \dx{} in the pool after the trade. It is also possible to put liquidity into the pool, and remove liquidity from it. 

The bank has two basic operations. It can mint new \dx{} tokens and 

Now we are going to consider how to put restrictions and design rules for the system to have stable price of \dx{}. 

\section{Stability}

What provides stability for the stablecoin when we have the design sketched in the previous section? 

\section{Worst Scenario and Bank Reserves}

The bank is doing interventions when the situation is far from normal on the markets, and enough time passed for markets to stabilize themselves with no interventions. In our case, the bank is doing interventions based on stablecoin price in the liquidity pool in comparison with oracle provided price~(we can assume that price on other markets is similar to liquidity pool\'s due to arbitrage). The bank\'s intervention then is about injecting its \bc{} reserves into the pool.  

We start with introducing notation: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item{} $T$ - period before intervention starts. After one intervention the bank can start another one after $T$. 
  \item{} $p$ - price reported by the oracle at the moment (for example, 20 USD per ERG)
  \item{} $s$ - price which the bank should stand in case of price crash. For example, we can assume that $s = \frac{p}{4}$ (so if p is 20 USD per ERG, then $s$ is 5 USD per ERG, means the bank needs to have enough reserves to save the markets when the price is crashing from 20 to 5 USD per ERG)
  \item{} $e$ - amount of \bc{} in the liquidity pool 
  \item{} $u$ - amount of \stc{} in the liquidity pool
  \item{} $O$ - amount of \stc{} outside the liquidity pool. The distribution in $O$ is not known for the \dx{} protocol.
\end{itemize}  

First of all, let's assume that price crashed from $p$ to $s$ ...
