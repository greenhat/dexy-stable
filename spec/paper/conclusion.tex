\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we propose to improve quality of blockchain protocol implementations via exhaustive property-based testing. For generic abstract modular Scorex framework, we have implemented a suite of property-based tests. The suite consists of 59 tests checking different properties of a blockchain system. To run the suite against a concrete blockchain protocol client, developers of the client need to provide generators for random objects used by the protocol. The suite is checking properties against the implementation by using random samples. We used Twinscoin implementation provided with Scorex as an example of a concrete blockchain using our testing kit. In the paper we provide many examples of the tests.
