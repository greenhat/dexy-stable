\section{Introduction}

Algorithmic stablecoins is a natural extension of cryptocurrencies, trying to 
solve problems with volatility of their prices by pegging stablecoin price to an
asset which price believed to be more or less stable with time (e.g. 1 gram of gold).  


Stable pricing could be useful for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item securing fundraising;
\item doing business with predictable results. For example, a hosting provider knows 
\item shorting: .
\item lending and other decentralized finance applications. 
\end{enumerate}

Algorithmic stablecoins are different from centralized stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, which are 
convertible into underlying (pegged asset) via a trusted party. In case of an algorithmic stablecoin, its 
pegging is done via rebasement of total supply, or via imitating the trusted party, which holds.
